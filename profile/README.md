## About Ipster
Ipster builds an AI-driven call center that integrates with your website, CRM, database, and calendar. Routine questions are handled automatically and complex cases are routed to a human. Data is hosted in the Netherlands. See https://ipster.nl/ for more details.

This organization page describes the engineering codebases behind Ipster: services, integrations, and developer workflows.

## What lives here
- Edge Functions (Supabase): voice/ops endpoints, webhooks, adapters
- MCP repositories: model and context tools used by agents and internal apps
- Integrations: Shopify/CRM/telephony connectors, utility libraries
- Infra and tooling: CI/CD, observability, shared devcontainers

GitHub is the source of truth for deploys.
